## Big-Questions-to-be-answered-by-the-group
1.	How can our app improve the lives of the users? 
   - Digitalize the business card exchange process (no hard-shakes, no paper cards exchange, practice social distancing...)
   - A digital place to organize a collection of business cards (like an app wallet)
   - Personalize what info to share with others (you can create your own card template to share)
   - Keep all contact information up-to-date (updates on business card can viewed by anyone immediately)

2.	What STEPS do the users must take to use the app? 
- Users can create different business card templates to share with others
- User can press a share button; a hash will be generated. User can share the hash code to the recipient
- Recipients can add the business to their collections via the given hash code

3.	What is the name of our app? 
- CyberCard? DigiCard? To be determined…
